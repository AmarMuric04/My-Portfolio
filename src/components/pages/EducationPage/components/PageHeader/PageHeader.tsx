        I’m currently in my second year of university, where I’ve been actively
        exploring a mix of academic and hands-on projects. From coursework to
        personal initiatives, I’ve worked on everything from creative hobbies to
        practical solutions for everyday problems. These experiences are helping
        me build a strong foundation and develop skills that I’m excited to grow
        further.

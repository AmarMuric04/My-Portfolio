        My Education
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg">
        I’m currently in my second year of university, where I’ve been actively
        exploring a mix of academic and hands-on projects. From coursework to
        personal initiatives, I’ve worked on everything from creative hobbies to
        practical solutions for everyday problems. These experiences are helping
        me build a strong foundation and develop skills that I’m excited to grow
        further.

        But my education doesn’t stop there. Beyond formal courses, I’ve
        immersed myself in an uncountable amount of content related to
        programming, software development, and personal growth. From in-depth
        tutorials and technical deep dives to industry talks and
        self-improvement strategies,{" "}
        <span>
          I constantly seek new knowledge to refine my skills and expand my
          perspective
        </span>
        . Whether it{"'"}s staying up to date with the latest technologies ,
        exploring best practices, or improving problem-solving abilities,{" "}
        <strong>
          I believe in continuous learning as the key to growth and innovation.

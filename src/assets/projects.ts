It's like Udemy, but designed specifically for elementary schools, with all the bells and whistles like video streaming, progress tracking, and even AI-powered recommendations. We actually lost the first 12 hours because of Git issues, so we really only had about 12 hours to put everything together. Despite that rocky start, we managed to pull off a feature-packed and beautifully designed project that completely blew the competition away. I even remember peeking through the school’s glass door and seeing everyone so focused on their work—it was a bit nerve-wracking, but it pushed us to deliver our best. In the end, our quick thinking and determination earned us first place at the UNINP Hackathon 2024. It was an intense day, but one that truly showed what can be achieved under pressure.",

I built it as a school project using plain JavaScript, and it focuses on showing algorithms that help solve different puzzles. I designed the whole thing myself and organized the code using an MVC structure, which really helped keep everything neat despite the project's size—it's probably the biggest website I've ever put together in terms of pages and information.

What really makes SolveBox stand out is the extra touches I added along the way. For instance, I incorporated a built-in translator for Serbian, which I thought would be a neat feature to help users who prefer that language. I also experimented with interactive algorithm visualizations and step-by-step tutorials that not only look good but make understanding the underlying processes much easier. Overall, I'm really proud of how SolveBox turned out—it’s a project that blends a lot of learning with creativity, and it shows just how far I've come in my coding journey.`,

I was just starting out with React Router DOM, and I decided to create something that would let me experiment with new features and design ideas. I spent a lot of time tweaking the product filtering and cart management to make them as smooth as possible, and trying out Stripe integration was a real learning curve. I even went with a bold green color scheme because it’s my favorite—and it really gives the site a unique vibe. Although I set the project aside after a couple of weeks (since I hadn’t yet learned backend stuff), working on it taught me so much about building user interfaces and handling tricky integrations.

I won't lie; looking at its code now might even give you a heart attack! Back then, I was just figuring things out, and the project ended up being a mix of excitement and chaos. I had to work around a pretty annoying API that would reset after only 20 fetches, so I ended up juggling around 15 different ones just to keep the news rolling. Even with all that hassle, Newsly still delivers the latest news with a simple, responsive design that I've always appreciated.

What makes this project so special to me is not just the functionality, but how it marks the starting point of my journey. Every line of messy code is a reminder of how far I've come. I learned so much about API integration, performance optimization (especially with that infinite scroll), and just handling the ups and downs of real-world programming. Despite its rough edges, Newsly has a charm of its own—it's a tangible snapshot of my growth as a developer, and I’m proud to see it still live and kicking.`,
